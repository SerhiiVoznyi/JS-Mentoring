## 5 Practical Tasks And Solutions

It doesn't matter what subject you teach, differences in students performance are affected by how much they engage in deliberate practice. Researchers who have investigated expert and novice performance have uncovered important distinctions between deliberate practice and other activities, such as play or repetition.

### 1. Structured Practice Is Efficient

The better you manage your practice session time, the more targeted it will be and the faster you’ll learn in an organised manner. Learning is a time-consuming process – steady practice yields steady, positive results. And, there’s so much material to fully grasp in any field of study – for example, the difficulty level for mathematics in class 9 is very different from mathematics in class 12. The more effort you put in, the closer you’ll get toward your goals!

### 2. Practice Helps Internalize

While some skills are repeated at a conscious level – i.e. practicing tennis three days a week or taking piano lessons five times a week – some activities are internalized to a level you’re practicing them subconsciously. For example, when you walk or cook, these are activities you practice without even actively focusing on each task. When you practice your academic skillsets regularly, you’ll be surprised at how you end up internalizing information subconsciously during your downtime. In essence, practice helps a student apply knowledge or skills automatically, without having to dwell upon it too much. For example, when you were a five-year-old-kid, reading a sentence might have taken a lot of conscious effort, whereas today, reading this article feels effortless.

### 3. Practice Inculcates Discipline

Taking time out to practice requires focus, clear goal-setting and commitment – these are all skill sets that will come handy in the long-run, both in personal and professional areas of life. When you decide to sacrifice that extra hour of Netflix or playing video games with your friends for academic excellence, you will notice improvement, which will motivate you to stay strong on your path.

### 4. Practice Changes The Brain In Unique Ways

Research indicates short periods of practice can actually enhance the brain’s plasticity and change its structure. Brain imaging indicates that even a small lesson, on let’s say new words, can change the brain circuits and makes retrieval of information quicker. You can access more complex information stored in your long-term memory easily and apply it quickly through deliberate practice. Open-ended short answers tests are a great way to assess progress in this area!

### 5. Practice Sessions Act As Check-Posts

Academic practice sessions are not only an effective way to track progress in a particular area before a crucial milestone like a final exam, they act as useful check-points to flag weak spots in a timely manner so they can be addressed before it’s too late.
